# TL;DR
Small script written in Python with which you can quickly create and modify .json files that represent "state machines" in the form of a directed graph with a start state and end states

# Description
This is a small python script written in Python to aid me in one of my college Projects. Feel free to use.
It is a console tool with which you can create/edit .json files that represent a directed graph with additional features that make it more of a state machine (One start state and a list of end states)
